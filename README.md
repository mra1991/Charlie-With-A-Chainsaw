# Charlie With A Chainsaw
 A 3D isometric slasher Unity game
 
 Charlie With A Chainsaw is an isometric slasher game where players control a fox named Charlie 
 who battles a swarm of insectoids armed with spears across four distinct levels using his trusty chainsaw. 
 The ultimate goal is to defeat the queen insect, who serves as the final boss. 
 
 This project was a collaboration between me and two of my classmates. My responsibilities included coding the player and camera movements, 
 designing the four levels and boss fight, implementing the player's health and game manager, and programming various UI elements such as the map, 
 health bars for the player and enemies, and the pause menu.
